## Hello World 👋

My name is Neale, I'm an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, majoring in Computer science 🖥️. I'm a tinkerer of technology, and I find joy in learning new technologies and messing with software! 

* I'm an incoming Fullstack intern at HTX Q Team 🚀 (May - Aug 2023). 
* I’m looking to collaborate in any project! 🎉
